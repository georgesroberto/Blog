                <p>Manifesting is part of the law of attraction and it’s all about creating what you want .

                    For example you’re pitching a book to a publication . You keep thinking to yourself: “This is a long shot I don’t stand a chance .They’ll never accept an article from someone like me .”
                    
                    Guess what happens ?<br>
                    You’ve subconsciously convinced yourself that you aren’t good enough . That attitude will show in your writing and then you’ll be turned down by the publication company which just reaffirms your belief that you’re not worth it .
                    
                    But if you go into this believing that you can do it and that you will be published then you have a better chance of reaching your goal of your book being published .
                    
                    That’s what manifesting is all about . Stop letting your automatic negative thoughts get in the way of manifesting your dream life . You already have what it takes to succeed in anything .All you need to is to believe you can and then you will .
                    
                    I’m a huge believer that all it takes to be happy in life is to have a positive mindset . That’s where your mindset is focused on growth and positivity to live a healthy mental and physical life . Manifesting is the main part of developing your positive mindset.
                    
                    That’s because even if you’re able to challenge your negative thoughts and learn from your experiences it still won’t help you unless you grasp the concept of believing that your goals are possible .
                    
                    When you get rid of any doubts existing in your mind you’ll be much closer to living your best life . It’s easier than you think it is to start manifesting.<br>
                    
                    A major part of manifesting is visualization . If you can’t picture your dream then it’s harder to make it real .<br>
                    
                    What do you want ?<br>
                    When do you want it ?<br>
                    What will you do to get it ?<br>
                    
                    When you create such questions in mind and draft answers to each question you begin to believe in it
                    
                    So if your intention is weak , then that’s how it will manifest in your life and you won’t be satisfied.<br>
                    
                    What does that mean ?<br>
                    
                    Don’t declare “ I hope I can be lucky enough to someday publish a book or something like that . “
                    
                    Give it a quick tweak
                    “I will be a published author within a year and my book will change someone’s life for the better “
                    
                    Once you put a desire into the universe, it becomes real . It exists somewhere out there and it’s your job to claim it . Make your intention powerful statements and believe in it and you will achieve it .</p>
